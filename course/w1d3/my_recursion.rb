# Estimated time: 5hrs

# Warmup

# Write a recursive method, range, that takes a start and an end and returns an
# array of all numbers between. If end < start, you can return the empty array.
# Write both a recursive and iterative version of sum of an array.

def range(start_number, last_number)

# Exponentiation
#
# Write two versions of exponent that use two different recursions:

# this is math, not Ruby methods.

# recursion 1
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, n) = b * exp(b, n - 1)
#
# # recursion 2
# exp(b, 0) = 1
# exp(b, 1) = b
# exp(b, n) = exp(b, n / 2) ** 2             [for even n]
# exp(b, n) = b * (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2) ** 2) [for odd n]
# Note that for recursion 2, you will need to square the results of exp(b, n / 2) and (exp(b, (n - 1) / 2).
#Remember that you don't need to do anything special to square a number, just calculate the value and multiply it by itself.
#So don't cheat and use exponentiation in your solution.

def exp_v1(b,n)

end

def exp_v2(b, n)

end

# p exp_v2(100, 22) #100
# p exp_v2(442,31) #64

# Suggestion: Break the methods down into parts.
#
# Suggestion 2: Try walking through your code with Simple Examples.
#
# If the n == 256, about how many nested recursive steps will we run in the first case?
#
# How deep will we need to recurse for the second? Keep in mind that the first r
# educes the exponent by one for each recursion, while the second reduces it by half.
#
# In addition to testing your methods by running the code, try the following exercise:
#
# On paper, write out the value of each variable for every line in the code:
#
# Write out what happens with base 0 and power 0 as inputs (should be easy). e.g., if you had run exp(0,0).
# Write out what happens for base 0 and power 1. e.g., if you had run exp(0,1).
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 0.
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 1.
# Write out what happens for base 1 and power 2.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 0.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 1.
# Write out what happens for base 2 and power 2.
# Make sure you can trace from the very beginning to the very end in these examples.
#
# How many examples do you need to walk through to be confident that it works?

# Fibonacci
#
# Write a recursive and an iterative Fibonacci method. The method should

# Binary Search
#
# The binary search algorithm begins by comparing the target value to
# the value of the middle element of the sorted array. If the target
# value is equal to the middle element's value, then the position is
# returned and the search is finished. If the target value is less than
# the middle element's value, then the search continues on the lower half
# of the array; or if the target value is greater than the middle
# element's value, then the search continues on the upper half of the
# array. This process continues, eliminating half of the elements, and
# comparing the target value to the value of the middle element of the
# remaining elements - until the target value is either found (and its
# associated element position is returned), or until the entire array has
# been searched (and "not found" is returned).
#
# Write a recursive binary search: bsearch(array, target). Note that
# binary search only works on sorted arrays. Make sure to return the
# location of the found object (or nil if not found!). Hint: you will
# probably want to use subarrays.
#
# This your first problem which is half a PITA to solve iteratively.
# Make sure that these test cases are working:

# [1,2,3], 3
# [1,2,3,4,5,6], 0

# Make Change
#
# RubyQuiz: Make change.
#
# Here's a game plan for solving the problem:
# First, write a 'greedy' version called greedy_make_change:
# Take as many of the biggest coin as possible and add them to your result.
# Add to the result by recursively calling your method on the remaining amount,
# leaving out the biggest coin, until the remainder is zero.
# Once you have a working greedy version, talk with your partner about
# refactoring this to make_better_change. What's wrong with greedy_make_change?
#

def greedy_make_change(target, coins)
  return [] if target <= 0 || coins.empty?

  change = []

  biggest_coin = coins.shift
  if biggest_coin <= target
    until target < biggest_coin
      change << biggest_coin
      target -= biggest_coin
    end
  end

  change + greedy_make_change(target, coins)
end

p greedy_make_change(24, [10, 7, 1])

# Consider the case of greedy_make_change(24, [10,7,1]). Because it takes
# as many 10 pieces as possible, greedy_make_change misses the correct
# answer of [10,7,7] (try it in pry).

def make_better_change(target, coins)
  return [] if target <= 0
  return nil if coins.all? { |coin| coin > target }

  best_change = nil

  coins.each do |coin|
    next if target < coin
    remainder = target - coin
    new_change = [coin]

    change_remainder = make_better_change(remainder, coins)
    next if change_remainder.nil?
    new_change += change_remainder

    if best_change.nil? || best_change.count > new_change.count
      best_change = new_change
    end

  end

  best_change
end


p make_better_change(24, [10, 7, 1])

# To make_better_change, we only take one coin at a time and never rule
# out denominations that we've already used. This allows each coin to be
# available each time we get a new remainder. By iterating over the denominations
# and continuing to search for the best change, we assure that we test for
# 'non-greedy' uses of each denomination.
#
# Discuss the following game plan and then work together to implement your new method:
#
# Iterate over each coin.
# Grab only one of that one coin and recursively call make_better_change
#  on the remainder using all of the same coins.
# Add the change for the remainder to the single coin you originally grabbed
# to obtain a possible solution.
# Keep track of the best solution and return it at the end.
# N.B. Don't generate every possible permutation of coins and then compare them.
#
# Make sure you and your partner understand each line before moving on.
